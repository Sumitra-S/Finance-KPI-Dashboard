## Finance KPI Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard providing detailed insights into sales performance, including total sales, target tracking, and team metrics. Features include dynamic visuals, performance trends, and real-time updates, making it ideal for sales teams and decision-makers.
About this project -
This dashboard leverages **DAX functions** in Power BI to deliver dynamic calculations and insights into sales performance. By utilizing DAX, we enable:
- Custom Calculations: Efficiently compute metrics like total sales, monthly targets, variance, and growth trends.
- Advanced Filtering: Drill down into data subsets for tailored analysis, such as team-specific or individual salesperson performance.
- Time Intelligence: Analyze data across different periods (e.g., year-to-date, month-to-date) to track progress and seasonality trends.
- Data Modeling: Optimize relationships and hierarchies within datasets for accurate reporting and visualization.

The use of DAX enhances the dashboard's interactivity and ensures real-time, actionable insights for decision-makers.
